# parse_json.py
In this example, the code makes a GET request to the JSON endpoint at https://xyz.com/data.json using the requests library. If the request is successful (status code 200), it converts the JSON response to a Python dictionary using the json.loads() method, extracts the important data from the dictionary, and saves it to a file named important_data.txt. If the request fails, it prints an error message with the status code.
# parse_nestedjson.py
In this modified example, the code assumes that there is a top-level key called top_level_key that contains a nested key called nested_key with the important data.
